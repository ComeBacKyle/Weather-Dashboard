Never listen to another meterologist again. THE Weather App is a one stop shop for all your weahter info needs. THE weather App provides you with real-time data to have you better prepared for your day. 


HOW IT WORKS:
        THE Weather App is powered by javascript, using the jQuery library it pulls from a reliable weather api that gives all the data presented.
    
Information Given:
        The Humidity of the city,
        The Temparature, and
        The Predicted forecast.

Future Development:
    The vision for the future includes being able to provide a five day forecast for users. There is also a call for improving the accuracy of THE Weather App using longitude & latitude coordinates.
